<b>Note</b> - The Vue web application needs the REST API service to be installed and running before the web application is started as the web application needs to be able to send requests to the APIs in this API service.

### Installation
Simply fork and clone a copy of this repo to your local device, open the folder in an editor with a terminal, I recommend VS code, and enter the command line 
```
npm install
```
This will ensure that all of the required packages and dependencies are imported and installed.  Then enter
```
npm run serve
```
To start the application running on a development server,  if the application does not open automatically after compiling, hold ctrl and click the local ip address to open the application in your default browser.

<br />
To get the full functionality of the application, user login is required, I have been using the following users for testing
<br />
